Solution to exercise 45 from http://www.ling.gu.se/~lager/python_exercises.html, quoted below:

"""

A certain childrens game involves starting with a word in a particular category. Each participant in turn says a word, but that word must begin with the final letter of the previous word. Once a word has been given, it cannot be repeated. If an opponent cannot give a word in the category, they fall out of the game. For example, with "animals" as the category,

Child 1: dog 

Child 2: goldfish

Child 1: hippopotamus

Child 2: snake
...

Your task in this exercise is as follows: Take the following selection of 70 English Pokemon names (extracted from Wikipedia's list of Pokemon) and generate the/a sequence with the highest possible number of Pokemon names where the subsequent name starts with the final letter of the preceding name. No Pokemon name is to be repeated.

Notes:

Takes about 5 million calls to process 70 Pokemon. 

Running time for even 151 Pokemon seems to be far too much. Will look into dynamic programming/efficient longest-path algorithms to improve on this!
